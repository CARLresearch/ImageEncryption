# ImageEncryption
## Introduction
There are a lot of building steps to get an image processing or encryption ecosystem up and running. These can be Broadly classified into *Confusion* and *Diffusion*

This Repo contains some of the code for each of these. 

## :checkered_flag: Confusion:
### 1. Arnold Cat Map
### 2. Chen's Hperchaotic System Based Shuffling

## :performing_arts: Diffusion with Chaotic systems:
### 1. Chen's Original 3D System
### 2. Chen's HyperChaotic System


We at Cognitive Applications Reearch Lab aim to make the lives of researchers all over the world so much easier. :crystal_ball: 

We hope this repo will be successful in doing that. :star2:
